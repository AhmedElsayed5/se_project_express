# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

It's the back-end chapter of this project. We are going to focus on building database that includes users and clothingItems and maintaing a relationship between each other, for example each clothing item has an owner which is a user, users allowed to like or dislike clothingItem

## Technologies

nodejs
express
linter
prettier
mongoosedb
postman

## Techniques

I built this project with (model, controller, route) method, where each item has these 3 files, for cleaner code and easier development. I also added a middleware to add user object to each request, I used JWT tokens and built an auth process to add security features to the application.

I used MongoDB compass to visualize the database

Used postman to text api requests
